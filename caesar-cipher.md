# Quiz - Decode this message!

Write a program to decode this message:

**FRZDUGV GLH PDQB WLPHV EHIRUH WKHLU GHDWKV, WKH YDOLDQW QHYHU WDVWH RI GHDWK
EXW RQFH.**

This is a form of cryptography known as the Caesar Cipher. It has a **shift parameter** of **3**.

The alphabet is normally:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

The alphabet with the shift parameter of 3 is now as follows:

DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC



---
### Extension:

Write the program to encode plain text into messages.
```
CaesarCipher.encode('TWO SYMBOLS KISSING EACH OTHER')
```

### Extension 2:

Write the program to encode it with any shift parameter.

Send each other secret messages.
