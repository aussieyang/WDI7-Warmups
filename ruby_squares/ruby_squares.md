## Ruby Squares!

A perfect square is defined as a whole number that when square rooted is a whole
number (such as 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.).

Make a new file called `get_squares.rb`.

Write a method called `get_squares` that takes an argument, an array of numbers. This method will return a new
array of numbers that qualify as perfect squares from the argument array.

**NOTE:** The returned array of perfect squares should be in ascending order with no duplicates.

```rb
get_squares([4, 1, 16, 1, 10, 35, 22]) # => [1, 4, 16]
```

### Done?
Solve it with a JavaScript function!

Store your solution in a new file called `getSquares.js` and run it in the console.

**HINT:** Sorting an array of numbers with `.sort` in JS would produce the following...

```js
getSquares([4, 1, 16, 1, 10, 35, 22]); // => [ 1, 16, 4 ]
```
What's that all about?!?!?!
