# Wordy Arithmetic

Write a program that takes a word problem in the format:

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

and returns the answer as an integer.

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

Write a series of test cases to run your program through.
