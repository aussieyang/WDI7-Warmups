###PALINDROME

---

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.

Write a function named "palindrome" that accepts one parameter, a STRING. If the word is a palindrome return true, if not return false.

EXAMPLE:

palindrome("Glenn")  #=> false
palindrome("Anna")   #=> true
